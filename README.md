# ai-for-the-arts

## Mission Statement
This repository is a curated portfolio that demonstrates my journey toward demystifying coding platforms and cultivating a nuanced understanding of code. It showcases not only my proficiency in using tools like GitHub, GitHub Codespaces, and Microsoft Copilot but also my ability to critically read, interpret, and reflect on code as a medium for creative expression. By integrating AI-assisted learning with hands-on exercises, my work bridges the gap between technical fluency and the broader cultural and ethical dimensions of digital practice, empowering audiences within the arts and humanities to engage with technology in meaningful ways.

### Course Goals 
Compile a repository of reflective notebooks and project artifacts that document my progress and insights that demonstrate both technical competence and the ability to communicate complex ideas to a broader arts and humanities audience.

- Develop proficiency in using GitHub Codespaces to create interactive, cloud-based development environments that support the experimentation and demonstration of programming concepts.
  - Learn to set up and manage repositories on GitHub, including creating branches, committing changes, and collaborating effectively using clear commit messages and best practices.
  - Connect technical skills with creative expression by exploring how coding can be used to present digital narratives and multimedia content, and by considering the social, cultural, and ethical implications of AI and computational tools.
  - Practice the art of reading and annotating code critically, identifying key programming constructs (such as variables, functions, loops, and data structures) while also reflecting on their broader significance in a cultural and artistic context.
    
- Navigating Cloud-Based Coding Environments
  - Become fluent with Microsoft Copilot to harness its AI-assisted suggestions for reading, troubleshooting, and understanding codeâ€”transforming potential challenges into learning opportunities.
